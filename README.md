# 🤖 Agglika Pastras Chatbot Demo

Welcome to the **Agglika Pastras Chatbot Demo**! 🎉 This project is a **proof of concept** for an AI-powered chatbot designed for the **English School of English** "Agglika Pastras". It runs on a **snapshot of the actual website** and demonstrates how an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system could enhance user interaction and support. 🚀

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Gemini-powered AI**: Utilizes Google's **Gemini** with a sophisticated system prompt.
- 📄 **Website Snapshot**: Operates on a frozen version of the school's website.
- 🏆 **Proof of Concept**: Showcases what a full-fledged **RAG solution** could achieve.
- 💡 **Intelligent Responses**: Designed to answer common inquiries about the school.

## 🎯 Goals

This project aims to:

- Demonstrate **AI-driven customer interaction**.
- Explore how **advanced prompting** can shape chatbot behavior.
- Provide a foundation for **future enhancements** with full RAG integration.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The chatbot is set up on a **static snapshot** of the school's website.
2. It utilizes **Gemini's AI capabilities** to respond to user queries.
3. The system prompt ensures **contextually relevant** and **helpful** answers.
4. Future iterations could integrate **real-time retrieval** for even smarter interactions.
